# GridSearchAlgorithm
Implementation &amp; Visualization of the 3 well-known path finding algorithms on the grid: Breadth First Search, Dijkstra Algorithms, A* Algorithm using SDL2 graphic library 

Download this repository. Make sure you have SDL2 graphic library installed on your computer. In addition in order to compile this project you'll need a secondary library called MATH which you can find among my repositories. Download it, compile in order to make a dynamic (or static, as you please) library so that you can link it to GridSearchAlgorithm
